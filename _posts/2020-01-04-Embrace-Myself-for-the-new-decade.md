## Diego's New Year's Resolutions
![main_image](/assets/images/new_dacade.jpg)

  **It has been the fourth day of the new decade 2020** and I was thinking to set my new year's resolutions using my phone but I realized I didn't usually keep it till the end so I decided to post the blog so that I can try to follow and accomplish that more and also I would know how many stuffs I make them work at the end of this year. 
  
  Last year I had just randomly done without coffee life since I was bored and needed to something to challange since I liked to try something new. Once I looked back for the year , I've never druken coffee even one cup (honestly I sipped it a bit from others but at least I didn't order it myself.) The reason I tried that challange is I want to prove myself that I can live witout coffee for a year and I am able to keep my words. 
  
  Anyways,I am writing my new year's Resolution which is mostly related with my major though but I gotta focus more on that since I will be graduated college this year(hopefully):haha:

### I. Reading IT blog post every day
- I occasinally read blog posts from medium but this year I decided reading blog post or any IT related stuffs which are written in English at least once a day so that I can impove my writing skills when I write technical stuffs   

### II. Running my blog more active
- I planned for this one last year but I failed and just posted one at 31th Dec(sigh) so I should have more specific and realistic plans for this one : uploading one blog post at least every months

### III. Developing React application
- I've been learning React following online lecture from Udemy and I really need to have my own project with the skills that I will learn from the lecture so that I can improve my programming skills and deeply understanding of React and JS. I will use the following tech that I've been learning to develop my own project 
`Redux`,`Electron` and `Next.js / serverless`

### IV. Developing Node application
- Since I am interested in JavaScript language, once I will finish learning React, I am planning to learn Node  which is also using JavaScript language. then I am developing my own project using that technolgy using `Express` framework
  
### V. Get certification from Amazon
- It is also my previous plan but I didn't even start it. I should put more efforts to get it and I am persuading to get a `Associate cloud solution architect` so that I can have a deeply understanding about AWS and using those technologies to my project.

### VI. Please graduate the college and getting a job
- I've been sitting as the undergraduate student for 7 years. well at least I didnt waste the time since I went army for mendatory duty for Korean guy and U.S for learning English and **Diversity**
    
### VII. Learning more about the CI/CD pipeline
- The key factor of extending my internship at U.S company is I was able to deal with the Jenkins which is the 101 for CI/CD even if I just leraned it. now I am going to put more effort to learn container and CI/CD stuffs which are Kubernates, Docker, Github action 
  
### VIII. Going on a vacation with the people I love with
- Since I had been gone abroad for last year, I barely had chances to go on a vacation with my family and Sakile. So I will try to plan it this year (Make money harder too! haha)
  
### IX. Reading books
- During those my life, I am not a that kind of person who enjoys reading books but nowadays I realized I watch too much black mirror in my life so I need to read books so that I can avoid watching screen all times and it should be hummanites stuffs (Plz no Tech stuff..) Realistically, I am gonna plan to read a book every two months at least(please!)
  
### X. Contribute to the open-sources
- I contributted to open-sources two times last year and It was a good exprience that I could interact and communicate with other developers so I am planning to do more than double compared with last year (Maybe more than 5 times)
